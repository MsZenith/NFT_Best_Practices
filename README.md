# NFT_Best_Practices
Some security best practices for all NFT projects.

## Discord security 101
- Never share your screen as a moderator
- Set up an alert system. A good alarm system is something like a tag for all online mods. Or an emergency on call system. Consider setting up a separate alert channel for the most active community members to use and then turn on notifications for that channel. Give your team your number ICE, etc.
- Create tiers with different access limits and permissions
- Seperate announcement channels
- Organise the permissions on your roles. i.e. moderators in most cases should only require the following permissions: delete messages, ...
- Have a crisis plan and make sure all your mods and the team understand what permissions are and what to do in a crisis

## Educate your community
- Start with the core and most active members. Don’t just say “don’t click DM links”. Explain to them some hard lines you will never do. Teach them the best way to reach out and sign the alarm. Then expand the group
